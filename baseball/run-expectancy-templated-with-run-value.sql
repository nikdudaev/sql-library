-- This script creates a dataset from Retrosheet events files.
-- This dataset will contain base/out state run expectancy and run value
-- In my setup I have PostgreSQL database called 'baseball'
-- In there there is a schema called 'retrosheet' with following tables:
--    - events
--    - game logs
-- I don't know if there is a way to do the same without intermediate tables

-- This is a basis query that prepares the original dataset
-- I create a new schema called 'run_expectancy' to hold all my calculations separately
